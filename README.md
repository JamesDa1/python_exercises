Cryptography:

Caesar Cipher: Encrypts a string with a given shift. (Example: shift = 3: a => d)
- Currently preserves spacing, and punctuation which makes it less secure than it could be
- Caesar cipher is generally weak since it can be easily broken by using frequency analysis to discover the key.
- Example, so letters are more likely to appear tha others, and some groupings are more common others. 
- If you know "A" has a relative frequency of 8%, but "K" in the encrypted text goes from 0.77% => 8%...
